# Sign Language to Text and Speech Conversion

This project converts sign language gestures into text and speech in real-time using computer vision and machine learning. It captures hand gestures via a webcam, processes them using a pre-trained CNN model, and displays the predicted characters and sentences on a GUI. The system also provides word suggestions and text-to-speech functionality.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Sign Language Detection**: Captures hand gestures using a webcam and displays a green hand skeleton for visualization.
- **Text Conversion**: Converts detected gestures into text, displaying individual characters and forming sentences.
- **Speech Output**: Converts the generated text into speech using text-to-speech functionality.
- **Word Suggestions**: Provides up to four word suggestions for the last detected word using an English dictionary.
- **Reference Image**: Displays a sign language reference image alongside the hand skeleton for user guidance.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Tkinter, featuring webcam feed, hand skeleton, predicted text, suggestions, and control buttons (Speak, Clear).
